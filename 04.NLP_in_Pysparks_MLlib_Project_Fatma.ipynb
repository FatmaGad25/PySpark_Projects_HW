them.We live in what we call the Age of Connection. With digital tools and technology and the explosion of social media, people have interpersonal connections and – more importantly for you – connections to brands in ways that they have never had before.With two or three ‘clicks’ (or ‘taps’) they can be talking to you. And equally – lest we forget – with a single click they can disconnect.This is where we work.We work with brands and their partner agencies to build those connections and we do it in many ways.We work strategically. The brand has primacy and we hold to that ensuring that the language and values of the brand are maintained at each touchpoint.We look for opportunities, we create opportunities and we manage those opportunities from beginning to end.And we tell stories. Because that, for us, is the heart of good communication – storytelling.We do it creatively, we do it seamlessly and we do it, on occasion, with a smiling guile and cunning.That’s what we do.|We are a boutique digital agency based in Auckland, serving a wide range of clients including some of New Zealand's best known and most loved consumer brands. We have an immediate need for a promising digital
